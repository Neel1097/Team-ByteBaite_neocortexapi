Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM):

Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) provides a theoretical framework that models several key computational principles of the neocortex. This paper analyzes an important component of HTM, the HTM spatial pooler (SP). The HTM spatial pooler represents a neurally inspired learning algorithm for creating sparse representations from noisy data streams in an online fashion. It models how neurons learn feedforward connections and form efficient representations of the input. It converts arbitrary binary input patterns into sparse distributed representations (SDRs) using a combination of competitive Hebbian learning rules and homeostatic excitability control.
